        <p>Arizona is a state in the Western United States, bordered by California to the west, Nevada to the northwest, Utah to the north, New Mexico to the east, and Mexico to the south. Known for its arid and warm climate, Arizona was historically a leader in cattle ranching, cotton and citrus farming, and copper mining during the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, its capital, Phoenix, is one of the top five largest cities in the United States and a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts, retirees, and those seeking year-round sunshine. Arizona is home to the Grand Canyon, one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World, drawing millions of visitors each year.</p>
