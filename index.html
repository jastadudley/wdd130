        <p>Howdy, from Arizona! My name is Jasta Dudley, and I am excited to be building my first website as I dive deeper into the world of web development. I thrive on learning new skills and embracing challenges, both in my personal and professional life. My hobbies include skiing, surfing, running, and hikingâ€”this past summer, I hiked the Grand Canyon, which was an unforgettable experience. I also have a passion for travel and reading, always looking for new ways to expand my knowledge and experiences.
            While I am just beginning my journey into computer programming, I am excited to explore fields like Affective Computing and Machine Learning. I am especially interested in the potential for artificial intelligence to improve communication and expand access to education, helping society in meaningful ways.
            In addition to my technical aspirations, I have a strong foundation in leadership and people skills. Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve held roles as a team lead, director, or supervisor, successfully managing teams and fostering collaboration. My ability to work well in a team and communicate effectively has been central to every role I've taken on, and I look forward to bringing those skills to the world of technology.</p>

        <img src="week01/images/arizona-landscape.jpg" alt="Arizona, Superstition Mountains">
        <p>Arizona is a state in the Western United States, bordered by California to the west, Nevada to the northwest, Utah to the north, New Mexico to the east, and Mexico to the south. Known for its arid and warm climate, Arizona was historically a leader in cattle ranching, cotton and citrus farming, and copper mining during the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, its capital, Phoenix, is one of the top five largest cities in the United States and a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts, retirees, and those seeking year-round sunshine. Arizona is home to the Grand Canyon, one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World, drawing millions of visitors each year.
